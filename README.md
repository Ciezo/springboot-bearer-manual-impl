# Extracting Bearer Tokens Manually

This project helps to understand how to manually extract Bearer tokens from Headers. I did this because I want to learn and know more about Authentication and Bearer Tokens. I know it is not the best code, but I have moved on from this little project as my personal interest and experiment. I am glad that now I learned to use Spring Security 6 and JWTs to secure endpoints and Spring Boot backend applications. 

**I have a lot to learn and I love it! ðŸ˜Š**
